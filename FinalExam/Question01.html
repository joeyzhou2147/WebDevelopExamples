        First, write a very small, basic HTML 5 page. Link to an external stylesheet, named
        "styles.css". In that external CSS file, configure an rule that will match on an attribute of
        alt="Read More" to have a color of #A52A2A. Then, create an embedded stylesheet in that
        same HTML 5 page, with a rule defined that says when there is an article element with span
        as a direct descendant that has an attribute of alt="Read More" to have the content within
        that span use 1 inch of spacing between its letters.
